# Economic variables are inter-related

.pull-right[
Economic variables are often (and usually) inter-related; for example,

- changes in income affect consumption; 
- changes in interest rates affect investment.

The dynamic linkages between two (or more) economic variables can be modeled as a *system of equations*, better known as a vector autoregression, or simply VAR.

# Vector autoregression

.right-column[
To begin, consider a bivariate first-order VAR. 

Let $\{X_{1t}\}$ and $\{X_{2t}\}$ be the stationary stochastic processes. A bivariate VAR(1), is then given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1t} &= \alpha_1 + \pi_{111}x_{1t-1} + \pi_{121}x_{2t-1} + \varepsilon_{1t} \\
x_{2t} &= \alpha_2 + \pi_{211}x_{1t-1} + \pi_{221}x_{2t-1} + \varepsilon_{2t}
\end{aligned}$$

where $\varepsilon_{1t} \sim iid(0,\sigma_1^2)$ and $\varepsilon_{2t} \sim iid(0,\sigma_2^2)$, and the two can be correlated, i.e., $Cov(\varepsilon_{1t},\varepsilon_{2t}) \neq 0$.

# Vector autoregression

An $n$-dimensional VAR of order $p$, VAR(p), presented in matrix notation: $$\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{\alpha} + \Pi_1 \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \ldots + \Pi_p \mathbf{x}_{t-p} + \mathbf{\varepsilon}_t,$$ where $\mathbf{x}_t = (x_{1t},\ldots,x_{nt})'$ is a vector of $n$ (potentially) related variables; $\mathbf{\varepsilon}_t = (\varepsilon_{1t},\ldots,\varepsilon_{nt})'$ is a vector of error terms, such that $\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbf{\varepsilon}_t\right) = \mathbf{0}$, $\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbf{\varepsilon}_t^{}\mathbf{\varepsilon}_t^{\prime}\right) = \Sigma_{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}$, and $\mathbb{E}\left(\mathbf{\varepsilon}_{t}^{}\mathbf{\varepsilon}_{s \neq t}^{\prime}\right) = 0$.

# A parameter matrix of a vector autoregression

.right-column[
$\Pi_1,\ldots,\Pi_p$ are $n$-dimensional parameter matrices such that: 
$$\Pi_j = 
	    \left[ 
		\begin{array}{cccc} 
		\pi_{11j} & \pi_{12j} & \cdots &  \pi_{1nj} \\ 
		\pi_{21j} & \pi_{22j} & \cdots &  \pi_{2nj} \\  
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots &  \vdots \\  
		\pi_{n1j} & \pi_{n2j} & \cdots &  \pi_{nnj} 
		\end{array} 
		\right],\;~~j=1,\ldots,p$$

# Features of vector autoregression

.right-column[
General features of a (reduced-form) vector autoregression are that:
- only the lagged (i.e., no contemporaneous) values of the dependent variables are on the right-hand-side of the equations.
  * Although, trends and seasonal variables can also be included.
- Each equation has the same set of right-hand-side variables.
  * However, it is possible to impose different lag structure across the equations, especially when $p$ is relatively large. This is because the number of parameters increases very quickly with the number of lags or the number of variables in the system.
- The autregressive order, $p$, is the largest lag across all equations.
]

---

# Modeling vector autoregression

.right-column[
The autoregressive order, $p$, can be determined using system-wide information criteria:

$$\begin{aligned}
& AIC = \ln\left|\Sigma_{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}\right| + \frac{2}{T}(pn^2+n) \\
& SIC = \ln\left|\Sigma_{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}\right| + \frac{\ln{T}}{T}(pn^2+n)
\end{aligned}$$

where $\left|\Sigma_{\mathbf{\varepsilon}}\right|$ is the determinant of the residual covariance matrix; $n$ is the number of equations, and $T$ is the total number of observations.
]

---

# Estimating vector autoregression

.right-column[
When each equation of VAR has the same regressors, the OLS can be applied to each equation individually to estimate the regression parameters - i.e., the estimation can be carried out on the equation-by-equation basis.

When processes are covariance-stationarity, conventional t-tests and F-tests are applicable for hypotheses testing.

# Testing in-sample Granger causality

.right-column[
Consider a bivariate VAR(p): 
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1t} &= \alpha_1 + \pi_{111} x_{1t-1} + \cdots + \pi_{11p} x_{1t-p} \\
&+ \pi_{121} x_{2t-1} + \cdots + \pi_{12p} x_{2t-p} +\varepsilon_{1t}  \\
x_{2t} &= \alpha_1 + \pi_{211} x_{1t-1} + \cdots + \pi_{21p} x_{1t-p} \\
&+ \pi_{221} x_{2t-1} + \cdots + \pi_{22p} x_{2t-p} +\varepsilon_{2t} 
\end{aligned}$$

- $\{X_2\}$ does not Granger cause $\{X_1\}$ if $\pi_{121}=\cdots=\pi_{12p}=0$
- $\{X_1\}$ does not Granger cause $\{X_2\}$ if $\pi_{211}=\cdots=\pi_{21p}=0$

# One-step-ahead forecasts

.right-column[
Consider realizations of dependent variables from a bivariate VAR(1): 
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1t+1} &= \alpha_1 + \pi_{11} x_{1t} + \pi_{12} x_{2t} + \varepsilon_{1t+1} \\
x_{2t+1} &= \alpha_2 + \pi_{21} x_{1t} + \pi_{22} x_{2t} + \varepsilon_{2t+1}
\end{aligned}$$

Point forecasts are:
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1t+1|t} &= E(x_{1t+1}|\Omega_t) = \alpha_1 + \pi_{11} x_{1t} + \pi_{12} x_{2t} \\
x_{2t+1|t} &= E(x_{2t+1}|\Omega_t) = \alpha_2 + \pi_{21} x_{1t} + \pi_{22} x_{2t}
\end{aligned}$$

# One-step-ahead forecasts

.right-column[
Forecast errors are: 
$$\begin{aligned}
e_{1t+1} &= x_{1t+1} - x_{1t+1|t} = \varepsilon_{1t+1} \\
e_{2t+1} &= x_{2t+1} - x_{2t+1|t} = \varepsilon_{2t+1}
\end{aligned}$$

Forecast variances are:
$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma_{1t+1}^2 &= E(x_{1t+1} - x_{1t+1|t}|\Omega_t)^2 = E(\varepsilon_{1t+1}^2) = \sigma_{1}^2 \\
\sigma_{2t+1}^2 &= E(x_{2t+1} - x_{2t+1|t}|\Omega_t)^2 = E(\varepsilon_{2t+1}^2) = \sigma_{2}^2
\end{aligned}$$
]

# Multi-step-ahead forecasts

.right-column[
Realizations of dependent variables in period $t+h$: 
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1t+h} &= \alpha_1 + \pi_{11} x_{1t+h-1} + \pi_{12} x_{2t+h-1} + \varepsilon_{1t+h} \\
x_{2t+h} &= \alpha_2 + \pi_{21} x_{1t+h-1} + \pi_{22} x_{2t+h-1} + \varepsilon_{2t+h}
\end{aligned}$$

Point forecasts are:
$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1t+h|t} &= E(x_{1t+1}|\Omega_t) = \alpha_1 + \pi_{11} x_{1t+h-1|t} + \pi_{12} x_{2t+h-1|t} \\
x_{2t+h|t} &= E(x_{2t+1}|\Omega_t) = \alpha_2 + \pi_{21} x_{1t+h-1|t} + \pi_{22} x_{2t+h-1|t}
\end{aligned}$$
]

# Multi-step-ahead forecasts

.right-column[
Forecast errors are: 
$$\begin{aligned}
e_{1t+h} &= x_{1t+h} - x_{1t+h|t} = \pi_{11} e_{1t+h-1} + \pi_{12} e_{2t+h-1} + \varepsilon_{1t+h} \\
e_{2t+h} &= x_{2t+h} - x_{2t+h|t} = \pi_{21} e_{1t+h-1} + \pi_{22} e_{2t+h-1} + \varepsilon_{2t+h}
\end{aligned}$$

Forecast variances are the functions of error variances and covariances, and the model parameters.

# Out-of-Sample Granger Causality

.right-column[
The previously discussed (in sample) tests of causality in Granger sense are frequently performed in practice, but the 'true spirit' of such test is to assess the ability of a variable to help predict another variable in an out-of-sample setting.
]

---


# Out-of-Sample Granger Causality

.right-column[
Consider restricted and unrestricted information sets:
$$\begin{aligned}
&\Omega_{t}^{(r)} \equiv \Omega_{t}(X_1) = \{x_{1,t},x_{1,t-1},\ldots\} \\
&\Omega_{t}^{(u)} \equiv \Omega_{t}(X_1,X_2) = \{x_{1,t},x_{1,t-1},\ldots,x_{2,t},x_{2,t-1},\ldots\}
\end{aligned}$$

Following Granger's definition of causality: $\{X_2\}$ is said to cause $\{X_1\}$ if $\sigma_{x_1}^2\left(\Omega_{t}^{(u)}\right) < \sigma_{x_1}^2\left(\Omega_{t}^{(r)}\right)$, meaning that we can better predict $X_1$ using all available information on $X_1$ and $X_2$, rather than that on $X_1$ only.
]

---

# Out-of-Sample Granger Causality

.right-column[
Let the forecasts based on each of the information sets be:
$$\begin{aligned}
	&x_{1t+h|t}^{(r)} = E\left(x_{1t+h}|\Omega_{t}^{(r)}\right) \\
	&x_{1t+h|t}^{(u)} = E\left(x_{1t+h}|\Omega_{t}^{(u)}\right)
\end{aligned}$$
]

---


# Out-of-Sample Granger Causality

.right-column[
For these forecasts, the corresponding forecast errors are:
$$\begin{aligned}
	& e_{1t+h}^{(r)} = x_{1t+h} - x_{1t+h|t}^{(r)}\\
	& e_{1t+h}^{(u)} = x_{1t+h} - x_{1t+h|t}^{(u)}
\end{aligned}$$

The out-of-sample forecast errors are then evaluated by comparing the loss functions based on these forecasts errors.
]

---

# Out-of-Sample Granger Causality

.right-column[
For example, assuming quadratic loss, and $P$ out-of-sample forecasts:
$$\begin{aligned}
RMSFE^{(r)} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{P}\sum_{s=1}^{P}\left(e_{1R+s|R-1+s}^{(r)}\right)^2} \\
RMSFE^{(u)} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{P}\sum_{s=1}^{P}\left(e_{1R+s|R-1+s}^{(u)}\right)^2}
\end{aligned}$$
where $R$ is the size of the (first) estimation window.

$\{X_2\}$ causes $\{X_1\}$ *in Granger sense* if $RMSFE^{(u)} < RMSFE^{(r)}$.
