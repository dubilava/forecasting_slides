# Simple Forecasting Methods

Recall that any guess may serve as a forecast, but an 'educated' guess is likely to be a better one.	We will now consider several simple methods for making an educated guess.

## The Average Method

The *average method* assumes that all future values of a given variable are equal to the mean of their historically observed values: `$$E(y_{T+h}|\Omega_T) \equiv y_{T+h|T} = T^{-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T}y_t,\;~~\forall\;h=1,2,\ldots$$`

---

# Simple Forecasting Methods

## The Naive Method

The *naive method* assumes that all future values of a given variable are equal to its most recent realization: `$$E(y_{T+h}|\Omega_T) \equiv y_{T+h|T} = y_T,\;~~\forall\;h=1,2,\ldots$$`

This method is derived from a *random walk* model, which assumes that the future is the present plus an unpredictable disturbance: `$$y_{t} = y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t},\;~~\varepsilon_{t}\sim iid(0,\sigma^2)$$`

---

# Simple Forecasting Methods

Alternatively, we can assume that the series are a random walk around a linear trend: `$$y_t = y_{t-1}+\delta+\varepsilon_t,\;~~\varepsilon_t\sim iid(0,\sigma^2),$$` where `$$\delta = E(\Delta y_t) = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=2}^{T}\Delta y_t = \frac{y_T - y_1}{T-1}$$`

It then follows that: `$$E(y_{T+h}|\Omega_T) \equiv y_{T+h|T} = y_T + h \delta = y_T + \frac{h(y_T - y_1)}{T-1}$$`

---

# Simple Forecasting Methods

## Simple Exponential Smoothing

The average and naive forecasting methods can be seen as the two extreme cases of what is known as the *simple exponential smoothing* (SES). 

SES offers something 'in-between' of the aforementioned two methods. That is, larger weights are assigned to more recent observations, and the weights decrease exponentially (hence the name) as the lags increase.

---


# Simple Forecasting Methods

A one-step-ahead forecast from SES is given by: `$$y_{T+1|T} = \alpha y_{T} + (1-\alpha)y_{T|T-1},$$` where `\(0 \leq \alpha \leq 1\)` is a smoothing parameter. Substitute recursively to obtain: `$$y_{T+1|T} = \sum_{i=0}^{T-1}\alpha\left(1-\alpha\right)^{i}y_{T-i} + (1-\alpha)^T y_{1|0}$$` In practice, `\(y_{1|0}\)` is often simply set to `\(y_1\)`.

---


# Simple Forecasting Methods

A forecast for horizon `\(h\)` at time `\(T\)` is equal to a weighted average of the most recent realization of the random variable and its forecast:
`$$y_{T+h|T} = \alpha y_{T} + (1-\alpha)y_{T|T-1},\;~~\forall\;h=1,2,\ldots$$` That is, SES also has a 'flat' multi-step forecast function (which is intuitive, as both the average and naive methods also have 'flat' multi-step forecast functions).

---


# Measures of Forecast Accuracy

The most commonly applied accuracy measures are the mean absolute forecast error (MAFE) and the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE):
`$$\begin{aligned}
\text{MAFE}  = &amp; \frac{1}{P}\sum_{i=1}^{P}|e_i|\\
\text{RMSFE} = &amp; \sqrt{\frac{1}{P}\sum_{i=1}^{P}e_i^2}
\end{aligned}$$`
where `\(P\)` is the total number of out-of-sample forecasts.

---


# Measures of Forecast Accuracy

Forecast accuracy should only be determined by considering how well a model performs on data not used in estimation.

At this point it is worth mentioning that a model which fits the data well, may not necessarily forecast well. While a perfect fit can always be achieved by using a model with 'enough' parameters, such overfitting can be seen as bad as failing to identify the systematic pattern in the data.

---


# Generating and Evaluating Forecasts

In model-based forecasting, 'genuine' forecasts are made based on information from in-sample environment, but are assessed in an out-of-sample setting.
- The in-sample segment of a series is also known as the estimation set or the training set.
- The out-of-sample part of a series is also known as the hold-out set or the test set.

---


# Generating and Evaluating Forecasts

Consider a time series, `\(\{y_t\}\)`, with a total of `\(T\)` observations. We can divide the sample into two parts, the in-sample set with a total of `\(R\)` observations, such that `\(R &lt; T\)` (typically, `\(R \approx 0.75T\)`), and the out-of-sample set. he goal is to recreate a 'genuine' forecasting environment.

For example, If we are interested in one-step-ahead forecast assessment, this way we will produce a sequence of forecasts: `\(\{y_{R+1|R},y_{R+2|{R+1}},\ldots,y_{T|{T-1}}\}\)` for `\(\{Y_{R+1},Y_{R+2},\ldots,Y_{T}\}\)`.

Forecast errors, `\(e_{R+j} = y_{R+j} - y_{R+j|{R+j-1}}\)`, then can be computed for `\(j = 1,\ldots,T-R\)`.

---


# Generating and Evaluating Forecasts

Three forecasting schemes are available for a forecaster: recursive, rolling, and fixed.
- The recursive forecasting environment uses a sequence of expanding windows to update model estimates and the information set.
- The rolling forecasting environment uses a sequence of rolling windows of the same size to update model estimates and the information set.
- The fixed forecasting environment uses one fixed window for model estimates, and only updates the information set.

---


# Forecast Error Diagnostics

Forecast errors of a 'good' forecasting method will have the following properties:
- zero mean; otherwise, the forecasts are biased.
- no correlation with the forecasts; otherwise, there is information left that should be used in computing forecasts.
- no serial correlation among one-step-ahead forecast errors. Note that `\(k\)`-step-ahead forecasts, for `\(k&gt;1\)`, can be, and usually are, serially correlated.

Any forecasting method that does not satisfy these properties has a potential to be improved. 

---


# Forecast Error Diagnostics

## Unbiasedness

Testing `\(E(e_{t+h|t})=0\)`. Set up a regression: `$$e_{t+h|t} = \alpha+\upsilon_{t+h} \hspace{.5in} t = R,\ldots,T-h,$$`
where `\(R\)` is the estimation window size, `\(T\)` is the sample size, and `\(h\)` is the forecast horizon length. The null of zero-mean forecast error is equivalent of testing `\(H_0: \alpha = 0\)` in the OLS setting. For `\(h\)`-step-ahead forecast errors, when `\(h&gt;1\)`, autocorrelation consistent standard errors should be used.

---


# Forecast Error Diagnostics

## Efficiency

Testing `\(Cov(e_{t+h|t},y_{t+h|t})=0\)`. Set up a regression: `$$e_{t+h|t} = \alpha + \beta y_{t+h|t} + \upsilon_{t+h} \hspace{.5in} t = R,\ldots,T-h.$$` The null of forecast error independence of the information set is equivalent of testing `\(H_0: \beta = 0\)` in the OLS setting. For `\(h\)`-step-ahead forecast errors, when `\(h&gt;1\)`, autocorrelation consistent standard errors should be used.

---


# Forecast Error Diagnostics

## No Autocorrelation

Testing `\(Cov(e_{t+1|t},e_{t|t-1})=0\)`. Set up a regression: `$$e_{t+1|t} = \alpha + \gamma e_{t|t-1} + \upsilon_{t+1} \hspace{.5in} t = R+1,\ldots,T-1.$$` The null of no forecast error autocorrelation is equivalent of testing `\(H_0: \gamma = 0\)` in the OLS setting.
